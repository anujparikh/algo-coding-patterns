# Tree - Breadth First Search

- problems involving trees with Breadth first search
- any problem involving the traversal of tree in level-by-level order can be efficeiently solved using bfs
- we will use queue to keep track of all the nodes of a level before we jump onto the next level
- space complexity of the algorithm will be O(W), where W is max number of nodes on any level
